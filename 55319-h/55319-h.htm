<h2><span class="small"><i>Administration</i></span></h2>
<p>Olympic National Park, established on June 29, 1938, and containing
about 1,400 square miles, is administered by the National Park
Service, U.S. Department of the Interior.</p>
<p>The National Park System, of which this park is a unit, is dedicated
to conserving the scenic, scientific, and historic heritage of the United
States for the benefit and enjoyment of its people.</p>
<p>A superintendent, whose address is 600 East Park Avenue, Port
Angeles, Wash., 98362, is in immediate charge of the park.</p>
<h2><span class="small"><i>America&rsquo;s Natural Resources</i></span></h2>
<p>Created in 1849, the Department of the Interior&mdash;America&rsquo;s Department
of Natural Resources&mdash;is concerned with the management, conservation,
and development of the Nation&rsquo;s water, wildlife, mineral,
forest, and park and recreational resources. It also has major
responsibilities for Indian and territorial affairs.</p>
<p>As the Nation&rsquo;s principal conservation agency, the Department
works to assure that nonrenewable resources are developed and used
wisely, that park and recreational resources are conserved, and that
renewable resources make their full contribution to the progress,
prosperity, and security of the United States&mdash;now and in the future.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Here is truly a living wilderness nurtured by the
ocean! The Olympic Mountains stand first in line against the
moisture-filled Pacific winds. These winds, rising and cooling on the western
slopes, drop 12 to 18 feet of rain and snow on forest and mountain each year. Two
extraordinary conditions result&mdash;a temperate-climate rain forest and an abundance
of permanent ice bodies at comparatively low altitudes. Many rushing streams
return the water from snowfields, glaciers, and forest slopes to the sea. A complete
and endless circuit of water from ocean to land and back to the ocean may be
observed from a single mountain vantage point. One can hardly fail to notice a
water cycle of this magnitude and completeness or to appreciate its great influence
on the Olympic scene.</i></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p class="tb">Olympic rocks tell of their having been formed of mud, sand, and
lava, uplifted from the sea; they tell of earth disturbance that alternately
submerged the land beneath the sea and elevated it into mountains.
The rocks and the shape of the land also tell of colder
climates, when ice from the north made almost a glacier island of the
Olympic Mountains, and of mountain valley glaciers which sculptured
the mountains during thousands of years. The rugged beauty of the
Olympic high country, enhanced by scores of mountain lakes, bears
testimony to the former presence of these extensive glaciers.</p>
<p>Only about 11,000 years have passed since the last wave of northern
ice retreated and laid bare Olympic rocks. Since then the moist and
gentle climate has favored the growth of plants and the development
of soil. The present Olympic forests and flowering meadows are
products of a succession of plantlife from the first lichens and mosses
that grew on Olympic rocks. Animals returned when the ice retreated.
Plant eaters and meat eaters, large and small, throve in abundance.
When primitive man came, he found the land and sea kindly. He
easily obtained what he needed for food, clothing, and shelter without
depleting the supply.</p>
<p>While most of the Northwest was being explored and settled by the
white man during the 19th century, the bulk of the Olympic Peninsula
remained virtually unknown. Its rugged mountains, dense forests, and
isolation contributed to the delayed advance of modern civilization to
this northwesternmost corner of conterminous United States. The
Olympic Peninsula thus remained one of the last frontiers, and the
park retains genuine wilderness quality, even to its boundaries which
descend to sea level.</p>
<p>In this piece of original America the perceptive eye and mind will
find a functioning model of nature&mdash;a model of earth forces, climate,
and life.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">The Mountains Are Formed</span></h2>
<p>The present Olympic Mountains were born between 12 and 20
million years ago when western Washington was pushed up into a
great range that extended from Cape Flattery southeastward to the
eastern part of the State. At the same time, the land to the north
and south was depressed and remains depressed today as Juan de
Fuca Strait and Chehalis Valley, respectively. The Olympics were
further elevated about 5 million years ago. This coincided with the
building of the Cascade Mountains and the down-folding of the land
between to form the Puget Sound trough. The Olympics were now
isolated, having lowland on all sides.</p>
<p>Olympic rocks formed in shallow seas that at least five times have
covered western Washington. Sediments washed from adjacent land
areas and accumulated on the sea bottom. Muds became shales and
sands were cemented into sandstones. Molten lava erupted through
these beds and was quickly cooled by the water. Thousands of feet
of rock material formed in this way.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>When earth forces lifted the sea floor, the sea disappeared, and for
long periods there were mountains where the sea had been.</p>
<p>Pressure and heat changed the rocks, especially the sedimentary
rocks, which became harder and tougher. Shale changed progressively
into slate and phyllite. All of these rocks are found in the Olympic
Mountains. The sedimentary rocks and lava flows, originally
horizontal on the sea floor, were tilted and folded when uplifted and
this is how we see them today.</p>
<p>Long periods of erosion have removed thousands of feet of rock and
remolded the Olympics into magnificently rugged mountains. Thus,
earth forces build mountains and water slowly carries them back to
the sea. So it has been since the first rains fell upon the cooling earth.</p>
<p>Today only the oldest rocks remain, for these were the bottom layers.
The greater part of the Olympic Mountains are made up of these
rocks, now mostly slates and hardened sandstones. This includes all
the rock inside a horseshoe-shaped line running from the village of
Sappho east to Lake Crescent, Lake Mills, and Deer Park, then south
to the west side of Mount Constance and the north end of Lake Cushman
and then west to Lake Quinault. The horseshoe-shaped rim of
the mountains outside this line is mostly basaltic lava.</p>

<p class="pcap">MOUNT ANGELES SHOWS TILTED ROCKS UPHEAVED FROM THE SEA BOTTOM.</p>
</div>
<p>Because fossils are scarce in the oldest rocks, geologists are not certain
about their age, but they are thought to be about 120 million
years old. The rocks in the outer rim of the Olympic Mountains
contain more fossils. These have been found in the sandstones, shales,
and limestones interbedded with the thick volcanic rocks. Fish teeth,
marine clams, snails, algae, wood fragments, and microscopic shells
found here represent forms of life that existed 50 to 60 million years ago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Glaciation</span></h2>
<p>Other important geological events started about a million years ago.
As the climate of the world became colder a great ice sheet formed
to the north and moved down across Canada into the United States.
There were periods when the climate warmed and the ice retreated.
It advanced again when temperatures lowered during tens of thousands
of years. The sheet moved southward at least four times during the
last million years.</p>
<p>At the same time, valley glaciers flowed out of the mountains of
British Columbia, joined forces, and formed a piedmont glacier that
moved southward into Puget Sound and against the eastern edge of
the Olympic Mountains. A lobe of this glacier branched off and
flowed westward through Juan de Fuca Strait. This piedmont glacier,
at least 3,000 feet thick, rubbed the northern edge of the Olympic
Mountains and sent ice fingers up the valleys. It brought granite
boulders from the north and dropped them along the way when it
melted. Some of these granite boulders have been found near Camp
Wilder, 25 miles up the Elwa River Valley, and as high as 3,000 feet
on the side of Klahhane Ridge.</p>
<p>As the ice moved west along the northern border of the mountains,
it plowed and scraped the deepened and ancient valley that filled
with water when the ice melted. This valley contains Lakes Crescent
and Sutherland. These and numerous other telltale marks attest to
the work of a thick ice sheet.</p>
<p>Approximately 11,000 years have elapsed since the retreat of the
last northern ice sheet from Washington.</p>
<p>With the onset of colder climate, valley glaciers also formed in the
Olympic Mountains. They flowed from high mountain cirques down
the valleys, probably filling the valleys during times of greatest ice
volume and becoming thinner and shorter during times of warmer
climate. Like the larger ice sheets from the north, the valley glaciers
of the mountains must have advanced and retreated periodically. The
greatest advance was as much as 25 to 40 miles in the Hoh, Queets,
and Quinault Valleys. A terminal moraine left by a glacier dams
Quinault Valley and holds the lake behind it.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">The Shape of the Land Today</span></h2>
<p>Knowledge of the geological history of an area enables us to better
understand the shape of the land today. It will be recalled that earth
movements depressed the land on the north, south, and east, leaving
the Olympic Mountains standing alone, isolated from other mountains.
However, they are a segment of that elongated western fringe of
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
mountains known as the Coast Range. In all that range the Olympics
are the highest; yet, for western mountains they are not high, dominating
Mount Olympus being only 7,965 feet above sea level. This
is not to suggest, however, that the Olympics are small. These mountains
have their base at sea level, or not much above, and viewed
from any lowland position they appear impressive indeed. A mountain
climb will confirm this idea of their size.</p>
<p>The Olympics are not a single range of mountains but a profusion
of peaks and ridges with intervening valleys&mdash;a mountain dome 60
miles across from north to south and east to west, cut by glaciers and
numerous streams into rugged peaks and steep-walled valleys. There
are nearly a hundred named peaks in Olympic National Park.</p>
<p>Mount Olympus occupies a central position on the Peninsula. To
the west the ridges descend gradually and merge with the coastal
plain which varies from a few to 20 miles in width. The eastern half
of the Olympics maintains a high elevation all the way to the eastern
edge. There they drop steeply to Hood Canal, an arm of Puget
Sound, leaving but little lowland on that side of the Peninsula. The
mountains end abruptly on the north side, too, but with some foothills
between them and the shores of Juan de Fuca Strait, some 3 to 6
miles distant. Except for the western slopes, the ridges have a fairly
uniform elevation of between 5,000 and 6,000 feet, and the peaks rise
1,000 to 2,000 feet higher.</p>
<p>The Olympic high country shows the effects of glacier scouring
everywhere. Numerous lakes lie in basins that were scooped out by
the same glaciers that carved circular hollows at the heads of valleys.
Slopes sweep upward from the basins with increasing steepness and
in many places end in serrated rock ridges and pinnacles.</p>
<p>More than a dozen streams flow out of the Olympic Mountains,
returning rain and melt water to the ocean. They drop down steeply
from the high level basins; after a few swift miles they flatten out and
the water takes a slower pace.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Glaciers Today</span></h2>
<p>A glacier is an accumulation of ice large enough to move of its
own weight. Mountain glaciers form at high altitudes where snowfall
exceeds melting and the snow builds up annually until, largely
due to its weight, the lower layers become solid ice. When the depth
of this ice becomes great enough&mdash;100 feet or more&mdash;it will flow down
slope and the ice is transported to lower altitudes where warmer
temperatures cause the ice to melt. The glacier terminates where
this melting equals the amount of ice moving down from the area of
accumulation.</p>

<p class="pcap">LAKE ANGELES LIES IN A CIRQUE ON THE SIDE OF MOUNT ANGELES.</p>
</div>
<p>The glaciers in the Olympic Mountains today are small indeed
compared to the extensive glaciers that formerly filled the valleys and
sculptured the mountains. The shape of the land testifies that a
greater number of glaciers once were here. However, more than 60
glaciers, having a collective area of at least 20 square miles, are
present today in the Olympic Mountains. Mount Olympus alone has
6 major glaciers, and the total area of permanent snow and ice on it is
more than 10 square miles. Several other mountains also have glaciers,
notably Mounts Anderson, Christie, Tom, and Carrie.</p>
<p>In addition, there are numerous snow patches that remain from one
winter to the next but are not thick enough to form glaciers. Viewed
from a high position, a panorama of north-facing slopes presents a
profusion of snow and ice patches. The presence of so much snow
and ice in mountains of modest height does not mean they are enveloped
with inhospitable cold. It is due to the abundance of winter
snow and considerable cool weather which retards its melting.</p>
<p>Glaciers are very sensitive to climate. Even slight changes in snowfall
or temperature can cause them to advance or recede. Most
glaciers everywhere have been shrinking during the past century. In
recent years, western Washington climate has been cooler and wetter.
As a result, many glaciers in this region, including Blue Glacier, have
enlarged slightly.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">Climate and the Water Cycle</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all inorganic substances, acting in their own proper nature, and without
assistance or combination, water is the most wonderful. If we think of
it as the source of all the changefulness and beauty which we have seen in
clouds; then as the instrument by which the earth we have contemplated
was modeled into symmetry, and its crags chiseled into grace; then as, in
the form of snow, it robes the mountains it has made, with that transcendent
light which we could not have conceived if we had not seen; then
as it exists in the foam of the torrent&mdash;in the iris which spans it, in the
morning mist which rises from it, in the deep crystalline pools which mirror
its hanging shore, in the broad lake and glancing river; finally, in that
which is to all human minds the best emblem of unwearied, unconquerable
power, the wild, various, fantastic, tameless unity of the sea; what shall we
compare to this mighty, this universal element, for glory and for beauty?
or how shall we follow its eternal changefulness of feeling? It is like
trying to paint a soul.&mdash;<i>Ruskin</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The earth&rsquo;s supply of water is fixed&mdash;it is used over and over again.
What falls on land as rain or snow runs off, evaporates, or sinks into
the ground. That which sinks into the ground may return: (1) to the
air, by transpiration from plants and by evaporation from soil; and
(2) to the sea, as ground water either flowing into streams or directly
into the sea. All water falling upon the land eventually returns to
the sea or to lakes whence it came. It evaporates and precipitates
again and again. This continuous round of moisture is known as the
hydrologic, or water, cycle. It is impressively demonstrated in the
Olympics.</p>
<p>Salt water borders the Olympic Peninsula on three sides. Lowland
on the south completes the isolation of the mountains. From atop
some mountain peaks one can see the Olympic water cycle in its
entirety&mdash;ocean, &ldquo;cloudscape,&rdquo; snowfields, glaciers, streams from source
to mouth returning water to the sea, and forests transpiring moisture
into the air.</p>
<p>A landscape is an expression of climate. The Olympic landscape,
with its rain forests, snowfields, glaciers, lakes, and numerous streams
in deep valleys, is a superb expression of a superhumid climate.
Abundant water is the prime source of Olympic&rsquo;s character. The
prevailing on-shore winds acquire much moisture in passing over the
ocean. The windward slopes of the Olympics cause this nearly
saturated ocean air to rise. Consequently, the western slopes of the
Olympic Mountains receive the greatest precipitation in the conterminous
United States.</p>
<p>The Hoh Ranger Station has a mean annual precipitation of 142
inches, with 174.6 inches recorded in 1961. Precipitation on Mount
Olympus recorded in 1958 was 149 inches but this same year only
130 inches were received at the Hoh. Scientists who have been studying
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
Blue Glacier on Mount Olympus since 1957 believe the heads of
the western valleys receive 200 inches in some years.</p>
<p>Marine climates have greater precipitation in winter than in summer.
Seventy-six percent of the yearly precipitation in northwest
Washington occurs during the 6 months between October 1 and
March 31. There is no definite time for the beginning and ending
of the &ldquo;dry&rdquo; and &ldquo;rainy&rdquo; seasons, as the transition is gradual and
variable.</p>
<p>The Olympic Peninsula would be well watered even if there were
no mountains. The mountains, however, are responsible for wringing
the bulk of the moisture from the saturated clouds and for creating
local variations in the amount of precipitation. After passing over the
mountains, the air is warmed in descending the leeward slopes.
Consequently, the lowland areas on the lee side of the mountains are
much drier than on the windward side. For instance, on the Olympic
Peninsula at Sequim (pronounced Squim) the mean annual precipitation
is less than 17 inches, and irrigation is required for successful
agriculture.</p>
<p>Another prominent characteristic of the climate is the mildness of
the winters at low elevations. In fact, western Washington is milder
in winter than any other section of the continent in the same latitude.
The reasons for this are the warming influence of the ocean and the
protecting influence of the Cascade Mountains and of the Rocky
Mountains against the flow of cold continental air westward to the
coast.</p>
<p>Storm centers that pass eastward across Washington in winter shift
to the north in summer, resulting in sunny summer weather that is
delightfully cool under the influence of the ocean.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">The Forests and Wildflowers</span></h2>
<p>Our continent has a variety of climates, and each climatic area has
its appropriate vegetation. Generally, the interiors of continents do
not have forests, but have grass or desert vegetation. The most
luxuriant forests develop near oceans where climate is sufficiently
moist. This is true of other continents as well as North America.</p>
<p>The differences in the general character of our natural vegetation
from coast to coast and border to border are apparent despite three
centuries of man&rsquo;s disturbance in the East and one century in the
West. Sizeable samples of some of the many kinds of original vegetation
are preserved in national parks and monuments. These are
precious remnants of our plant heritage that become more valued
year by year in proportion to their scarcity elsewhere.</p>
<p>The mild, humid climate of the northern half of the Pacific slope is
unusually favorable for forest growth. The most luxuriant of the
western forests developed here in unbroken stretches. The forests that
girdle the Olympic Peninsula represent the best development of this
evergreen forest domain. Its ultimate composition is of western hemlock
and western redcedar in dense stands, with trunks commonly 4
to 6 feet in diameter and 125 to 200 feet tall. Their crowns shut out
most of the sunlight, but enough gets through to the bottom of the
forest for the growth of mosses and ferns. Shrubs grow dense and
tall, in places becoming almost impenetrable to hikers. Fallen trees
of all sizes soon are enveloped by the lush growth in the damp shade,
and in time return to the soil through decay.</p>
<p>Hemlock and redcedar seedlings take root in the forest litter or on
prostrate, moss-covered trunks. They are able to live in the deep
shade. The most hardy of them outstrip their rivals, and when a
vacancy occurs in the forest canopy their growth speeds up. Thus a
forest of hemlock and redcedar is maintained. This is the climax
forest in the lowlands of the northwest coast. It is the kind of forest
the climate here will produce and maintain in the absence of
interference.</p>
<p>Interference has been the rule, however, both before and since the
coming of man. Therefore, the climax forest is less common than
the subclimax in which Douglas-fir is the dominant tree. Forest fires
have repeatedly exposed the forest floor to sunlight and thus allowed
the development of Douglas-fir, by far the most abundant and widespread
tree in northwest forests. In the regeneration of a forest after
fire, logging, or other disturbance, it is Douglas-fir that is ever present.</p>
<p>The northwest coast is an evergreen land. This may not be apparent
in summer, however, when all plants are green. Not counting
the numerous mosses that are always green, there are 73 species of
evergreen plants on the Olympic Peninsula.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h3 id="c7">RAIN FOREST</h3>
<p>An extraordinary forest has developed along the western slopes of
the Coast Range where moisture is available in the greatest abundance.
The most typical and beautiful expression of this coastwise
forest is found in the western valleys and on the coastal plain of the
Olympic Peninsula. It is the most luxuriant growth in any temperate
climate and may properly be called a rain forest. This temperate-climate
rain forest, however, is not like the rain forests of the hot,
superhumid tropics. Here, there are tall conifers instead of broad-leaved
trees; there are mosses and ferns on the ground instead of an
understory of vines.</p>
<p>The rain forest is principally distinguished by the presence of Sitka
spruce. This tree grows only in a narrow belt along the coast from
northern California to Alaska. The other trees of the rain-forest
community have much wider distribution.</p>
<p>The trees of this forest are among the largest in the world. Many
of them have trunks that exceed 10 feet in diameter at 4&frac12; feet above
the ground, and are up to 300 feet tall. The largest known trees in
the park for the most common species are: western redcedar, 21 feet
4 inches in diameter; Sitka spruce, 13 feet 4 inches; Douglas-fir, 14
feet 5 inches; western hemlock, 9 feet; and Pacific silver fir, 6 feet
10 inches.</p>
<p>A visit to the rain forest offers a surprisingly enjoyable experience.
Although it is possible to drive through some sections, this provides
only a view of the trees. A forest is more than a stand of trees&mdash;it
includes animal life, smaller plants, and micro-organisms, such as
bacteria. All these serve the forest and in turn, their well-being
depends upon the forest. They form the forest community.</p>
<p>Splendid examples of rain forest may be seen in the Hoh, Queets,
and Quinault Valleys, but the Hoh Valley is the most accessible. A
paved road runs 19 miles up the Hoh from U.S. 101, ending 7 miles
inside the park boundary where a National Park Service campground
has been developed. The Hoh River Trail starts just beyond the
nearby visitor center. It extends 18 miles to Glacier Meadow, close
to Blue Glacier on Mount Olympus. Approximately 12 miles of it is
in rain forest along the valley bottom. Only a small fraction of this
distance need be traveled, however, to see the forest.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, one finds this forest beautifully luminous. It is filled
with soft, green light that drops down where it can find room between
the towering spruces and hemlocks. In the lower levels of the forest
it filters through the translucent leaves of the vine maple and bounces
from one green surface to another. Nature, in an exuberant mood,
has lavishly decorated this forest with mosses and clubmosses. Moss
carpets, with patterns of Oregon oxalis and beadruby, cover the forest
floor. The same material upholsters fallen trees and the trunks of
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
those standing. Mosses ascend to the very tops of some of the tallest
trees. Arched trunks of vine maple are cushioned with them. Curtains
of clubmosses hang from the same archways, separating one
green forest room from another.</p>

<p class="pcap">MOSS AND BEADRUBY PATTERN ON THE FLOOR OF THE RAIN FOREST.</p>
</div>
<p>The forest cycle from seed germination to death of giant trees and
their return to soil may be seen here in the course of a short stroll.
This is a cycle endlessly repeated. No part of it is disturbed by man.
Trees felled either by uprooting or by breaking of the trunk are
scattered everywhere in various degrees of decay. Rain-forest trees
have shallow but widespreading roots. To obtain nourishment, there
is no need for deep roots where water is available in dependable
abundance. But shallow roots in saturated soil do not always anchor
trees firmly enough against storm winds.</p>
<p>Though dead and prostrate, the fallen trees still have an important
function in the forest. They are soon accepted into the forest-floor
community and become covered with lichens and mosses. Various
fungi and bacteria attack them from within. They become nurseries
for spruce and hemlock, whose seedlings prefer rotting wood. The
most vigorous seedlings outgrow all others and send their roots down
the flanks of the rotting log and into the ground. Such old nurse
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
logs, if big enough, will last until the trees they foster grow to large
size. Colonnades of huge trees may thus be seen straddling old moldering
logs. Seeds may even take root upon a broken stump 12 feet
or more above the ground. The roots reach the soil after creeping
down the full length of the stump. The result, when the stump rots
and crumbles away, is a tree standing on stilts. Thus the forest is
regenerated. New life compensates death. There is neither increase
nor decrease in total amount. What is dead eventually returns to
soil and feeds the living. This is brought about through the work
of saprophytes&mdash;plants without chlorophyll, the substance which gives
plants their green color. They must obtain their food already made
and are content to take it dead. Many of these are mushrooms and
other fungi with colorful and beautifully shaped fruiting bodies. No
better description of their function in the forest can be found than
that written by Donald Culross Peattie.</p>

<h3 id="c8">MOUNTAIN VEGETATION</h3>
<p>A visit to Olympic is not complete without at least one trip into
the high country. Aside from the numerous trails that lead up into
the mountains, there are two high country areas that may be reached
by car. These are Hurricane Ridge and Deer Park. Whether the
trip is made on trail or on road, an understanding of the changing
pattern of plantlife will make it more enjoyable.</p>
<p>The climate at the top of a mountain is unlike that at the base;
accordingly, the plants are different. Plant scientists have found that
these vegetation differences on a mountain are similar to the changes
seen between the equator and the poles. Generally speaking, each
100-foot rise in elevation is equivalent to about a 20-mile distance
north. Although the change may be gradual, there are distinguishable
belts of vegetation on a mountain. These belts are called life
zones and have names that indicate their correspondence to zones
between the equator and the poles.</p>
<p>Altogether there are four life zones in the Olympic Mountains:
Transition, Canadian, Hudsonian, and Arctic-Alpine. The vegetation
of the last three is similar to that of regions to the north at lower
elevations, as indicated by their names.</p>
<p>The Transition zone in the Olympics is the lowest. It is intermediate
between southern and northern vegetation. The lowland
forests, including the rain forest already described, are in this zone.</p>
<p>The next two zones also are forest, but somewhat different. The
highest, or fourth, zone is treeless. The boundaries between the forest
zones here are not sharp; it is difficult to know exactly where one
ends and the next begins. This merging of forest zones in the Olympic
Mountains may be due to the equable temperature extending well
up the mountain slopes.</p>
<p>The Canadian zone should be apparent when an elevation of 2,000
feet is reached. The forest of this zone is somber compared with that
of the Transition zone. Although it has many kinds of small shrubs
and herbaceous plants, it lacks the striking greenness of the Transition
forest. Western white pine and Pacific silver fir have entered it.
Western redcedar is absent, while Douglas-fir and western hemlock
remain. There are numerous saprophytes on the forest floor&mdash;most
of them flowering plants such as pinedrops, Indian-pipe, and coralroot.</p>

COURSES OF THE RAIN FOREST RIVERS.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The Hudsonian zone is next, and is the highest one having forest
vegetation. Around 3,500 feet elevation there is a mingling of Canadian
and Hudsonian trees. Some trees of the Canadian zone are still
found, but some different kinds are included in the forest composition.
The characteristic Hudsonian zone trees are mountain hemlock, Pacific
silver fir, alpine fir, and Alaska-cedar. The last-named has typical
cedar foliage. Its branches and twigs droop as if they were wilted.
Trees in this zone are much smaller than those at lower altitudes and
become still smaller with every upward step. At the uppermost fringe
of tree growth the winds hold them close to the ground as deformed
growths. This is known as <i>krummholz</i>, a German word meaning
&ldquo;crooked wood.&rdquo; The name is applied to stunted forest commonly
found in alpine regions. Timberline in the Olympic Mountains is
generally at about 5,000 feet, which coincides with the height of many
of the ridgetops. The beginning of the Hudsonian zone is the beginning
of the high country. The sky is bluer and in summer an alpine
fragrance adds zest to the air. The forested slopes give way, in depressions,
to meadows that are brilliant with wildflowers in summer.
Basins carved by snow and ice hold numerous mountain lakes, with
streams flowing into and out of them.</p>

color. Aster, pedicularis, arnica, shootingstar, cinquefoil, and false-hellebore
are among the conspicuous flowers there.</p>
<p>Stream margins and marshy ground are preferred by such plants
as marshmarigold and globeflower.</p>

<p class="pcap">MEADOWS AND CLUSTERS OF TREES OF THE HUDSONIAN ZONE.</p>
</div>
<p>Higher in the Hudsonian zone there are prairielike meadows where
flowers bloom in profusion. Extending 60 miles across the north and
east sides of the park there are thousands of acres of this meadowland
on the ridges. Hurricane Ridge is in the midst of this and presents
some of the finest flower displays. Some slopes in early summer are
white with avalanche lilies, one of the most abundant and widespread
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
of the mountain flowers. Near timberline they grow among the trees,
as well as in the open. Other meadows are yellow with pure stands
of glacier lily, one of the earliest of spring flowers. Impatient with
winter, it pushes through the thinning snowbanks. Where soil is
deep, subalpine lupine blooms profusely. Among the most common
and conspicuous in rich meadows are larkspur, buttercup, cinquefoil,
paintbrush, arnica, tiger lily, and mountain buckwheat.</p>
<p>Several plants found in the mountains in the northeast part of the
park, where rainfall is lighter, are more typical of the hot, arid lowlands
of eastern Washington and Oregon. Some of these are nodding
onion, woolly eriophyllum, and barestem lomatium&mdash;their presence in
the mountains may be due to the fact that the broad ridgetop meadows
in the northeastern part of the park are remnants of a lower plain
where these plants grew before the Olympic Mountains had risen to
their present height. As the mountains were pushed up, these plants
could have continued to grow and reproduce despite changing
conditions.</p>
<p>On hillsides where the rock has weathered only into chips, or where
little soil has formed, carpets of spreading phlox and rosettes of Lyall
lupine are most conspicuous in early summer. Some plants grow on
talus slides, on rocks broken and tumbled from peaks above, and on
rocks laid bare by retreating glacial ice. Lichens and mosses, pioneers
among plants, etch the rock with weak acids and thus start the slow
conversion of rock into soil. Some flowering plants are pioneers, too.
Common ones growing in crevices and soil pockets among the rocks
in the Hudsonian zone are smooth douglasia, alumroot, and bluebell.
Eventually, a flowered meadow or forested slope develops where first
there was only bare rock.</p>
<p>The Arctic-Alpine zone is the region above timberline. It corresponds
to the arctic meadows of northern Canada. In the Olympics
its lower limit is about 5,000 feet and its upper limit is the tops of
the peaks.</p>
<p>It is a harsh environment. Its shallow soil and rocks, its wind and
prolonged snow and cold exclude all but the hardiest perennials.
Annuals cannot live there. One growing season is too short for a
plant to start from seed, complete its vegetative growth, flower, and
ripen its seeds. Many of the plants are surface plants, such as mosses
and lichens, which do not produce flowers. But even the flowering
plants hug the ground. Their over-wintering buds are at or below
the ground surface. It is a struggle for moisture and against time.
Only low perennials, having small, tough leaves covered with hairs or
wax, are able to survive. These properties help protect the plants
against loss of water.</p>
<p>There are 8 kinds of mountain plants in the Olympics that are
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
not known to grow anywhere else. It appears that these plants grew
in the Olympic Mountains before the ice came and were able to survive
on ridgetops that remained free of glacial ice during the long
cold periods. They are thus relicts from preglacier time. None of
them are trees and only two are shrubs. All the rest are herbs. Several
of these, among which piper bellflower and Flett violet are
especially attractive, may be found on Hurricane Ridge and on the
upper slopes of Mount Angeles.</p>
<p>Snow is vital to mountain flowers. It provides most of the moisture
for their growth and governs the length of the growing season.
Spring flowers appear earliest where the snow melts first. Where
snow piles up deeply, it may not melt completely till midsummer or
may melt too late for plants to complete a season&rsquo;s growth. On
northern slopes the snow may remain all summer, and there can be
no growing season.</p>
<p>The high country has many floral patterns, which change as the
seasons progress. The flower displays are usually best around the
middle of July. Flowers of spring, summer, and autumn are blooming
then, according to the progress of the seasons in different elevations
and habitats.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">How To Identify Some Common Plants</span></h2>
<p>Out of more than a thousand kinds of trees, shrubs, ferns, and
flowering herbs on the Olympic Peninsula, 28 are described in the
following paragraphs. While this is but a small fraction of the total,
they represent the most common and noticeable plants that can be
identified easily.</p>
<p>The park is a sanctuary for all natural features, and care should
be taken not to disturb, injure, or destroy trees, flowers, or other
plantlife.</p>
<h3 id="c10">TREES</h3>
<p><span class="small">DOUGLAS-FIR</span> (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>) gives principal distinction to the
Northwest forests. Growing from sea level to 5,000 feet elevation, it
is the most abundant and widespread tree on the Olympic Peninsula.
Average mature trees in the virgin forests of the lowlands are 180 to
250 feet in height and 4 to 6 feet in diameter. The largest on record&mdash;14
feet 5 inches in diameter&mdash;is located in the Queets River Valley,
about 3&frac12; miles by trail from the end of the road. Next to the
sequoias of California the Douglas-fir is the largest tree in the forest
of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Large Douglas-firs in the forest commonly have nearly cylindrical
boles, clear of limbs for a hundred feet. Such trees have a reddish-brown
bark which is rough with ridges and deep furrows. The cones,
whether on the tree or on the ground beneath the tree, provide easy
and reliable identification. They are mostly 2&frac12; to 3 inches long with
3-pointed, thin bracts protruding among the scales. The seeds are a
favorite food of the Douglas squirrel.</p>
<p><span class="small">WESTERN REDCEDAR</span> (<i>Thuja plicata</i>) grows in the valley bottoms and
other moist places. Although it is mainly a lowland tree, it extends
up into the Canadian zone wherever conditions are favorable. Large
trees in the forest average 150 to 175 feet in height and 3 to 8 feet
in diameter. The largest western redcedar on record is 21 feet 4
inches in diameter. It is located in the Pacific Coast Area near Kalaloch
and can be reached by a short spur road near Beach Trail 6.</p>
<p>The trunk of the western redcedar commonly tapers rapidly from
a swollen and sometimes fluted base. Its bark is thin, fibrous, and
stringy. The foliage hangs in long, lacy sprays. It is the only tree
of the lowland forests which has leaves that are tiny, overlapping scales.</p>
<p><span class="small">WESTERN HEMLOCK</span> (<i>Tsuga heterophylla</i>) is abundant in Northwest forests
up to about 3,000 feet elevation. Large forest trees are 125 to 175 feet
in height and 2 to 4 feet in diameter. The largest recorded specimen of
this tree, 9 feet in diameter, is located above Enchanted Valley in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
park. Western hemlock can be identified by its foliage and cones. The
needles vary in length from &frac14; to 1 inch and are pliable and round-pointed.
The lacy sprays of foliage have a delicate appearance. The
top shoot of the tree bends over in an arc&mdash;another identifying characteristic.
The cones, about three-quarters of an inch long, are usually
abundant near the ends of the branches.</p>
<p><span class="small">SITKA SPRUCE</span> (<i>Picea sitchenis</i>) is a coastwise tree from Alaska to California.
In the park it is common only in the rain forest on the west
side. There, large trees are 225 to 300 feet in height and 5 to 8 feet in
diameter. Many are 10 feet or more in diameter. The largest specimen
recorded, 13 feet 4 inches in diameter, is located in the park about
4 miles above the Hoh Ranger Station. Sitka spruce and the three
preceding species comprise what might be called the &ldquo;big four&rdquo; in
Olympic forests.</p>
<p>Sitka spruce can be identified by its stiff and very sharp-pointed
needles. They are &frac12; to &frac14; inches long and extend outward from all
sides of the twig. It can be distinguished from other associated trees
by the thin silvery-gray to purplish-gray scales on its bark. The base
of the tree is commonly enlarged because of the massive roots that
grew downward from the top of a stump or large fallen tree where
the seed germinated.</p>

<p class="pcap">SITKA SPRUCE CONES HANG IN CLUSTERS AT THE ENDS OF BRANCHES.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p><span class="small">PACIFIC SILVER FIR</span> (<i>Abies amabilis</i>) is a tree of middle elevations, or
the Canadian zone. In favorable sites, it attains a height of 140 to
160 feet and a diameter of 2 to 4 feet. The record tree, 6 feet 10
inches in diameter, is by the Bogachiel River about 8 miles by trail
from the end of the road. A striking characteristic of this needle-leaved
tree is its smooth, ashy-gray bark, conspicuously marked with
chalky-white areas and numerous resin blisters.</p>
<p><span class="small">ALPINE FIR</span> (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>) is the spirelike tree of the highest life zone,
the Hudsonian. Under favorable conditions it reaches a height of
60 to 90 feet, but at timberline it is a twisted, stunted growth only a
few feet high. Its narrow crown extends to the ground, which makes
this tree particularly susceptible to crown fires. Many ridgetop areas
have &ldquo;silver&rdquo; forests of bleached trunks of fire-killed alpine fir. The
purple to gray-purple cones, 2 to 4 inches long, stand upright on the
branches as in all true firs.</p>

<p class="pcap">NUMEROUS SMALL RESIN-FILLED BLISTERS ON A PACIFIC SILVER FIR.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="small">ALASKA-CEDAR</span> (<i>Chamaecyparis nootkatensis</i>) is a Hudsonian zone tree,
easily identified by its foliage. The slender, drooping branches and
flat, weeping sprays appear to be wilted. The leaves are of tiny, overlapping
scales. This tree could be confused with the western redcedar,
but as the two grow at different elevations identification should
be easy. The largest specimen recorded, 7 feet 8 inches in diameter,
is on the trail to Hart Lake above Enchanted Valley.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p><span class="small">PACIFIC MADRONE</span> (<i>Arbutus menziesii</i>) is a tree of the lower elevations
distinguished by its smooth, reddish-brown trunk and branches and
its shiny, leathery, broad-leaved, evergreen foliage. The bark of the
trunk may be loosely scaly, peeling off in long, thin, irregular pieces.
This is especially noticeable in late summer when new, light-green
bark is exposed by the flaking away of the older red bark.</p>
<h3 id="c11">SHRUBS</h3>
<p><span class="small">SALAL</span> (<i>Gaultheria shallon</i>) is the most common shrub in the forests of
the Olympic Peninsula. Near the coast it grows 6 to 10 feet high in
nearly impenetrable stands. Inland and at higher elevations up to
about 3,000 feet, it is much smaller. Its evergreen, leathery leaves
with finely toothed edges are easily distinguished from those of other
shrubs. They are oblong and mostly 2 to 3 inches long. Urn-shaped,
white to pink flowers in 1-sided racemes become black, edible berries
later in summer. These berries were gathered by coast Indians and
made into syrup or thick, dried cakes.</p>
<p><span class="small">PACIFIC RED ELDER</span> (<i>Sambucus callicarpa</i>). This large shrub becomes
noticeable along roadsides in summer because of its large, dense clusters
of brilliant red &ldquo;berries.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="small">CREAMBUSH ROCKSPIREA</span> (<i>Holodiscus discolor</i>) is an erect shrub, growing
5 to 14 feet high. In June it becomes conspicuous in lowlands because
of its numerous, large, dense, drooping sprays of cream-colored
flowers. Ocean spray is another common name for this shrub.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">

<p class="pcap">SALAL IS ONE OF MANY BROAD-LEAVED EVERGREEN PLANTS.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h3 id="c12">NONWOODY PLANTS</h3>
<p><span class="small">FIREWEED</span> (<i>Epilobium angustifolium</i>). The rose-colored, spirelike, flowered
tops attract attention wherever it is found. The name fireweed
has been given because it comes up quickly in burned areas. It is
not restricted to burned places, however, for it grows wherever there
is unpreempted space in sunny locations, as along roadsides. It may
be seen in flower throughout the summer, since it grows from sea
level to 5,000 feet in elevation. The blooming progresses to higher
elevations as the season advances. Its leaves are similar to those of
willow, which accounts for another common name&mdash;willowweed.</p>
<p><span class="small">WESTERN SWORDFERN</span> (<i>Polystichum munitum</i>). This is the western counterpart
of the common Christmasfern. It is a large, conspicuous,
evergreen fern&mdash;the most prominent fern in these forests. The individual
leaflets are lance-shaped, have fine-toothed edges, and are
attached to the stem of the frond by means of a short stalk.</p>
<p><span class="small">DEERFOOT VANILLALEAF</span> (<i>Achlys triphylla</i>). This is probably the most
common herbaceous, flowering plant in these forests from sea level to
about 4,000 feet in elevation. It is a foot or more in height and
commonly forms extensive patches. It can be identified easily by the
three broad, fan-shaped leaves at the top of the slender, wiry stem.
If the central leaf is bent back, the other two represent a spreading,
green-winged butterfly. The small flowers form a slender, white, upright
spike above the leaves. The foliage contains a compound which
has the fragrance of vanilla. This is given off when the leaves wilt
and accounts for another popular name&mdash;sweet-after-death.</p>
<p><span class="small">OREGON OXALIS</span> (<i>Oxalis oregana</i>). This small, delicate, white-flowered
plant, has leaves that resemble a three-leaf clover. It grows among
the mosses in the moist, shady forest and is especially noticeable in
the plant carpet on the floor of the rain forest. The plant contains
oxalic acid, which gives the leaves a pleasant sour taste. Another
common name is wood sorrel.</p>
<p><span class="small">QUEENCUP BEADLILY</span> (<i>Clintonia uniflora</i>). The hiker will find this attractive
plant in flower at middle elevations, mostly in the Canadian zone.
Each plant has two or three prominent, narrowly oblong, lilylike
leaves growing from the base of the plant and one clear-white, lilylike
flower. The fruit is a single turquoise berry.</p>
<p><span class="small">OREGON WINTERGREEN</span> (<i>Pyrola rotundifolio</i>). This handsome pyrola is
found up to about 3,000 feet elevation. Several leathery, roundish
leaves, which have stems as long as the leaves, arise from the base of
the plant and spread out to form a rosette. They are glossy green on
top. From the center of this rosette rises a reddish flower stalk, 8 to 16
inches tall, that bears pink to reddish, waxy flowers about a quarter
of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p><span class="small">SUBALPINE LUPINE</span> (<i>Lupinus subalpinus</i>). Early in July the mountain
meadows become ornamented with large patches of this blue-flowered
plant. Its flowers are the shape of pea blossoms. Lupine can be
identified by the leaf, which consists of many leaflets radiating from
a central point like the spokes of a wheel. This lupine is a leafy
plant 8 to 24 inches high.</p>
<p><span class="small">LYALL LUPINE</span> (<i>Lupinus lyallii</i>). This small lupine grows in dry, rocky
soil at higher elevations, mostly above timberline in the Arctic-Alpine
zone. Its small, but typically lupine, leaves are hairy and spread out
to form a rosette. The blue flowers, in many short, compact spikes,
usually are spread in rosette manner.</p>

<p><span class="small">AVALANCHE LILY</span> (<i>Erythronium montanum</i>) is a white lily, with a yellow
center, abundant in early summer on mountain meadows and in woods
near timberline.</p>
<p><span class="small">GLACIER LILY</span> (<i>Erythronium grandiflorum</i>). This plant is similar, except
that the flowers are yellow and slightly smaller. It blooms earlier
than its white counterpart and one must look for it where the snow
is melting. Both the avalanche and glacier lilies have two basal leaves.</p>

<p><span class="small">SCARLET PAINTBRUSH</span> (<i>Castilleja miniata</i>). The brilliant color of this
plant is not in its flowers, which are hidden, but in the leafy bracts
that surround them. One can imagine that the &ldquo;flowers&rdquo; are brushes
dipped in scarlet paint and then turned upward.</p>
<p><span class="small">MAGENTA PAINTBRUSH</span> (<i>Castilleja oreopola</i>) is similar to the scarlet paintbrush,

<p><span class="small">OWLCLOVER</span> (<i>Orthocarpus imbricatus</i>) is a relative of the paintbrushes; it
may be incorrectly identified as one of them. The &ldquo;flower&rdquo; is
magenta-colored, but it differs from that of the paintbrush in being
compact and nearly ball-like. Each plant has only one flower stalk,
while paintbrush usually has more than one. Paintbrush and owlclover
bloom in the mountain meadows in midsummer.</p>
<p><span class="small">TIGER LILY</span> (<i>Lilium columbianum</i>) is a tall, leafy plant of the rich
meadows that bears from two to many large, orange, brown-spotted
flowers. On the lowland meadows the flowers appear in May, but
in the meadows of the Hudsonian zone, they do not bloom until July.</p>
<p><span class="small">MOUNTAIN BUCKWHEAT</span> (<i>Polygonum bistortoides</i>). Although this flower is
not especially attractive, its abundance in mountain meadows gives it
importance among the common plants of the park. It grows thickly
among grasses and sedges, is 10 to 20 inches tall, and in July and
August bears a compact, oblong spike of white flowers at the top of
the slender stem.</p>
<p><span class="small">SPREADING PHLOX</span> (<i>Phlox diffusa</i>) is a prickly, mosslike plant that forms
cushions or mats on dry, gravelly slopes above timberline. In early
summer, it bears numerous, small, white-to-lavender flowers close to
the foliage. Entire hillsides may be covered with a patchwork of this
hardy alpine plant.</p>
<p><span class="small">BLUEBELL</span> (<i>Campanula rotundifolia</i>) grows from sea level to the dry, rocky

<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">Wildlife</span></h2>
<p>One of the reasons for establishing Olympic National Park was to
insure &ldquo;protection and preservation of interesting fauna, notably the
rare Roosevelt elk....&rdquo; There are 54 species and subspecies of wild
mammals occupying their primitive homes on the Olympic Peninsula
(Murray L. Johnson and Sherry Johnson, <i>Check List of Mammals of the
Olympic Peninsula</i>). Probably all of these occur within the park. The
wildlife picture is not a static one, however, as natural disturbances,
time, and man bring changes in numbers, kinds, and distribution.</p>
<p>Climatic changes have greatly affected the animal life. There have
been periods of extreme cold and periods of warmth. At least four
times the ice-age glaciers advanced and melted back. When ice sheets
moved down from the north and extensive glaciers formed in the
mountains, the animals left. When the ice retreated, the animals
returned. Not all animal types were able to survive, so that some
animals that once lived in Washington are now extinct. One of these
was the mastodon, resembling the present-day elephant. In 1950, a
fossil skeleton of a mastodon was found in an excavation on a farm
near Port Angeles, and tusks and parts of skeletons have been found
from time to time in the bluffs east of Port Angeles.</p>
<p>Because the Olympic Mountains are isolated from other mountains,
some animals of the Pacific Northwest have never found their way to
the park. For instance, several kinds of animals in the Cascade Mountains
are unknown in the Olympics. These include the mantled ground
squirrel, pika or cony, and red fox. The wolverine, now rare in the
Cascades, has never been seen in the Olympics. But animals move
about, and it is entirely possible that there will be natural additions
to the Olympic fauna. Dr. Victor B. Scheffer has stated that the red
fox and the porcupine are expected to invade the Peninsula sometime
in the present century. During 1951, two porcupines were seen on
the Peninsula near the ocean&mdash;one at Kalaloch and another south of
Queets Village.</p>
<p>Other changes have been brought about directly or indirectly by
man. The Olympic wolf&mdash;a big, gray, magnificent animal&mdash;was once
fairly numerous, but, because of merciless poisoning and hunting before
the park was established, it is now probably extinct.</p>
<p>The coyote, renowned for his ability to survive civilization, has
invaded the Olympic Peninsula during the present century. To some
extent this animal fills the ecologic niche left vacant by the disappearance
of the Olympic wolf.</p>
<p>Long before the National Park was established, mountain goats were
brought from British Columbia and Alaska and released on Mount
Storm King, near Lake Crescent. The transplanted animals have
thrived and multiplied, and have spread eastward across the park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h3 id="c14">YOU AND THE ANIMALS</h3>
<p>The animals of the park are an integral part of the wilderness scene.
The principal purpose for which the park was established was to preserve
and display the natural wilderness. Thus, the animals are wild,
living in their natural habitat. Not only must the animals and their
normal habits be preserved, but their wilderness home as well.
Whether the presence of man will be disturbing to the wilderness and
its dwellers depends upon how humans behave in it. Any act that
would tend to break down wilderness animal behavior is harmful to
wildlife and is a violation of park rules.</p>
<p>Proper behavior of park visitors in the presence of national park
animals may need explanation. The feeding of wild animals by man
is harmful to their best interest. For thousands of years they have
been able to feed themselves, and their continued well-being depends
on their doing so now and in the future. For example, black bears
in Olympic have not yet become troublesome, but bears, by nature,
are inclined to become spoiled if artificial feeding habits are encouraged.
Bears normally eat many kinds of plant and animal foods, but
a camper&rsquo;s larder contains tidbits that would tickle the palate of any
bear. If an animal learns to associate food delicacies with campers,
he will repeatedly seek experiences of that kind to the everlasting annoyance,
misfortune, and even tragedy of the campers. The thoughtless
camper who wilfully, or negligently, starts the bear on the road to
ruin may escape the consequences. It is the bear himself and people
who appear on the scene later who suffer for the deeds of earlier
campers. The bear may become a dangerous nuisance and may have
to be destroyed.</p>
<p>The only intelligent and humane solution is to refrain from all practices
which tend to disturb or change the animal&rsquo;s normal way of life.
Self-restraint and good camping practice are necessary in order to
accomplish this. Under no circumstances offer food to a bear or leave
food or garbage where he can get at it. Remember that he is powerfully
muscled and can climb trees. Refuse, including cans and bottles,
should be burned not only to destroy all that is edible but to destroy
food odors. Then, when the charred cans and bottles are placed in
refuse containers or buried, the bears will not smell them and dig
them out.</p>
<p>While emphasis has been placed on the proper relationship with the
bear, the same attitude toward other animals will help insure their
well-being and your safety. Any attempt to feed a deer or a bear
invites injury. Proper conduct in relation to wild animals is so important
that regulations now prohibit the feeding, touching, teasing,
or molesting of any bear, deer, elk, moose, bison, bighorn, or pronghorn
in National Parks. The first three are found in Olympic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h3 id="c15">SEEING THE MAMMALS</h3>
<p>As long as animals remain completely wild there is little danger
from them. The majority of mammal species are small, rare, secretive,
or nocturnal, so for these or other reasons they may not easily
be seen. They will try to avoid contact with people, and your problem
will be to find them and to get close enough to see them well,
without disturbing them. To do this, it is necessary to study their
habits and to meet them on their own terms.</p>
<p>There is no scarcity of animals in Olympic; but the conditions for
seeing even the larger ones, such as elk, deer, and bear, are not as
favorable as in Yellowstone National Park, for instance. Olympic has
less open country where unobstructed views may be enjoyed, especially
in the lowlands. Even in the high country the rolling or rugged topography
allows animals to move quickly out of sight behind ridges or
rock outcrops.</p>
<p>Do not let these difficulties discourage you. The following suggestions
may help you to see some of the more interesting mammals:</p>
<p>The <span class="small">ROOSEVELT ELK</span> is also popularly known as the Olympic elk, because
the largest remaining herds of this animal are on the Olympic
Peninsula. The number here totals approximately 6,000 animals.
These elk, however, still are found in various other parts of their original
range, which includes the coastal forests from southern British
Columbia to northern California.</p>
<p>The elk is the largest of the American deer family, except the moose.
The bulls sometimes weigh as much as 1,000 pounds and the cows,
700. Both sexes have a heavy brown mane and a pale, yellowish
rump patch. The bulls carry antlers, which are shed in late winter.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig31">

<p class="pcap">ROOSEVELT ELK IN A LUSH MOUNTAIN MEADOW IN OLYMPIC&rsquo;S WILDERNESS.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Generally, the elk spend winters in the lowland forests and summers
in the higher mountain meadows. Many of them, however,
remain in the lowlands even in summer, so that it is possible to see
elk in some of the western valleys of the park the year round.</p>
<p>During certain times of the year they are vocal. In May and June
when the calves are born the cows sometimes bugle, and more frequently
the calves give a high-pitched squeal.</p>
<p>Elk are polygamous and during the rutting season a bull will gather
a harem, consisting of a few to a dozen or more cows, which he attempts
to hold against all other bulls. There is much bugling by the bulls
then&mdash;thrilling wilderness calls. You will probably recognize the
source of this call the first time you hear it. The bulls become less
shy during the rutting season and will permit closer approach. This
should be done cautiously, however.</p>
<p>Almost any high-country meadow, except in the north to northeast
part of the park, may hold a herd of elk from July through September.
Cows, calves, and yearlings gather and remain in large herds
until split up by the bulls when the mating season begins in the autumn.
During summer, bulls remain apart from the cows, either in small
groups or alone. The rutting period lasts from early September to
mid-November, tapering off in the last month.</p>
<p>When the snow deepens in the mountains the elk that have summered
in the high country come down into the valleys, where they
gather in herds that may number 50 or more animals.</p>
<p>The <span class="small">COLUMBIAN BLACK-TAILED DEER</span> is one of the most frequently observed
larger mammals. Usually, it is seen in the early morning, late
afternoon, evening, and often at night&mdash;the preferred feeding times.
It remains bedded down in some secluded spot during much of the
day. Anyone driving in western Washington at night is likely to see
a deer suddenly bound out of the forest onto the highway. Where
highways pass through localities having large deer populations, signs
warn motorists of this danger.</p>
<p>In summer, deer prefer the upper Hudsonian zone, where forest
and meadow mingle to provide both nutritious food and nearby secluded
shelter. Hurricane Ridge and Deer Park are favorite summering
grounds, and a visit to either area at deer mealtime is likely
to be rewarding.</p>
<p>With encouragement and repeated opportunities to sample human
food, a deer will become &ldquo;spoiled&rdquo;&mdash;a beggar lacking the sleekness
and alertness of a wild creature. It is then no more than a specimen&mdash;like
a plucked flower about to wilt. Also, it is potentially dangerous
to the person who tries to feed it, for it can, and may, strike damaging
blows with its sharp hooves. In the autumn mating season, males,
&ldquo;tame&rdquo; or wild, can be dangerous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p><span class="small">BLACK BEARS</span> may be seen from sea level to alpine meadows in summer
and early autumn. The socially disinclined bear travels alone, except
for the mother with cubs. However, several bears may be in the same
neighborhood for the same reason&mdash;food. From a ridgetop, the sleek,
black forms may be seen against the green of the lush meadows below,
where they search out ants, small rodents, and succulent herbage of
various kinds. On mountain slopes covered with ripened huckleberries
in late summer, bears become so engrossed with gorging on the delectable
fruits that they may be stalked from downwind. A bear&rsquo;s
keen nose quickly distinguishes nonwilderness odors. Should a shifting
breeze waft a scent message his way, you will have to find yourself
another bear to stalk. A bear&rsquo;s hearing is good, but his vision is
less acute.</p>

<img src="images/p21.jpg" alt="" width="661" height="500" />
<p class="pcap">COLUMBIAN BLACK-TAILED BUCK.</p>
</div>
<p>Bears frequent valley bottoms and other lowland areas during late
autumn, winter, and spring and may be seen along streams during
salmon runs. Apparently, bears in the Olympics do hibernate, but
the mild winters make a long dormancy unnecessary. It appears
that all Olympic bears are black&mdash;the brown pelage phase has not
been reported.</p>
<p>A black bear is not a dangerous animal unless he has learned to
seek food from people or from their camps. Although a mother bear
with cubs is not to be trifled with, a bear without those family responsibilities
is easily frightened by a shout or other sudden loud noise.</p>

<p class="pcap">DEER FAWNS ARE COMMONLY LEFT ALONE WHILE THE MOTHER FEEDS.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="small">OLYMPIC MARMOTS</span> live just above or below timberline usually near
well-watered meadows bordered by alpine fir clumps. Some are
found on windswept ridgetop meadows or on rockslide areas. Marmots
come out of hibernation in May and remain active until early
September. They are most active in the early morning or evening
during warm summer days. They have many burrows, which are
easily spotted on alpine meadows. While they may feed long distances
from their home dens, they are seldom far from burrows down
which they can scurry at the first sign of danger.</p>
<p>Although marmots can best be seen and photographed on Hurricane
Hill or Deer Park, they also occur in other high-country locations.
The marmot blends well with his surroundings. You may
not be aware of his presence until you hear his shrill alarm whistle,
which at first you may mistake for a human whistle. It is so frequently
heard in marmot territory that the name &ldquo;whistler&rdquo; has been
given the animal.</p>

<h3 id="c16">BIRDS</h3>
<p>The snowy peaks, the mountain meadows, the forests, the lakes and
streams, and the salt-water shores of the Olympic Peninsula constitute
a variety of habitats for birds. The kinds of birds you can expect to
see depend on where you are.</p>
<p>In summer, there are approximately 140 species on the Olympic
Peninsula. The following list includes birds most easily identified and
most likely to be seen, and those of special interest. Many common
birds are not included.</p>
<h4><i>Birds of the Mountain Peaks</i></h4>
<p><span class="small">GRAY-CROWNED ROSY FINCH</span>&mdash;a rose-colored, sparrowlike bird, tame
and easily observed. It feeds characteristically on or near open, rocky
slopes and snowbanks.</p>
<h4><i>Birds of the Mountain Meadows and Timberline</i></h4>
<p><span class="small">HORNED LARK</span>&mdash;a brownish ground bird, whitish beneath, a little
larger than a sparrow. Usually in pairs on bare field and open
ground; they utter a plaintive <i>tee</i> when startled into flight. At close
range, the forehead and throat show a pale yellow, bordered and striped
with black. The male has two black, hornlike feather tufts on the
head.</p>
<p><span class="small">SPARROW HAWK</span>&mdash;a small, slender hawk with pointed wings and a
rusty-red tail and back. It commonly hovers in the air above fields
and meadows and is numerous on the ridges during grasshopper season.</p>
<p><span class="small">BLUE GROUSE</span>&mdash;a dark, hen-shaped bird commonly seen feeding on the
ground in meadows and woodland.</p>
<p><span class="small">GRAY JAY</span>&mdash;a usually silent, gray bird with a whitish area on top of
the head and a black patch behind the white. It is a little larger
than a robin. This jay appears at your camp or picnic expecting food
and sometimes helping himself to it.</p>
<p><span class="small">COMMON RAVEN</span>&mdash;distinguished from the crow by its greater size and
coarse, guttural croaks. It is seen on the meadows when grasshoppers
are abundant.</p>
<p><span class="small">MOUNTAIN BLUEBIRD</span>&mdash;&ldquo;... a flash of azure blue&mdash;a crumb from the
blue sky above!&rdquo; (E. A. Kitchin in <i>Birds of the Olympic Peninsula</i>.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p><span class="small">OREGON JUNCO</span> is the size of a sparrow, with black head, rusty-brown
upperparts and white underparts. The blackish tail has white outer
tail feathers.</p>
<p><span class="small">RUFOUS HUMMINGBIRD</span>&mdash;the smallest bird in the park. It can be
identified by the rapid, darting, humming flight.</p>
<p><span class="small">COOPER&rsquo;S HAWK</span>&mdash;a medium-sized hawk with short, blunt wings and
a long tail. Its flapping, darting, twisting flight, with comparatively
little soaring, is characteristic.</p>
<p><span class="small">RED-TAILED HAWK</span>&mdash;a large, soaring hawk with broad, blunt wings. In
adults the tail is red on top.</p>
<h4><i>Birds of the Forest</i></h4>
<p>Few birds live in the deep forest, but many prefer its edges near
streams and openings.</p>
<p><span class="small">OREGON JUNCO</span>&mdash;described in <i>Birds of the Mountain Meadows and Timberline</i>.</p>
<p><span class="small">WINTER WREN</span>&mdash;a tiny, dark-brown, short-tailed wren of the deep quiet
woods. It sings a trill song from atop a snag or small tree during
nesting season and scolds passers-by with staccato, rasping notes.</p>
<p><span class="small">RUFFED GROUSE</span>&mdash;similar to the blue grouse, but reddish-brown, with
broad, blackish band toward tip of the tail.</p>
<p><span class="small">PILIATED WOODPECKER</span>&mdash;a big, black, crow-sized woodpecker with a
white streak down each side of head and neck. The male has a
scarlet tuft on top of head. This bird is found in the deep forest,
particularly where there are many dead trees and snags.</p>
<p><span class="small">GRAY JAY</span>&mdash;described in <i>Birds of the Mountain Meadows and Timberline</i>.</p>
<p><span class="small">STELLER&rsquo;S JAY</span>&mdash;a harsh-voiced blue bird with black head and conspicuous
black crest.</p>
<p><span class="small">VARIED THRUSH</span>&mdash;somewhat resembles a robin, but has a black bib
across the breast. It is a bird of the deep forests, where it is more
often heard than seen. &ldquo;... out of the silence comes a long-drawn
quavering note with something of the quality of escaping steam; after
a short interval the note is repeated in a higher pitch, again in a
lower.&rdquo; (Ralph Hoffman in <i>Birds of the Pacific States</i>.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p><span class="small">RED-SHAFTED FLICKER</span>&mdash;a stoutly built woodpecker with a black bib
across the breast and a white rump. Orange underwings can be seen
when bird is in flight, which is markedly undulating.</p>
<p><span class="small">HAIRY WOODPECKER</span>&mdash;a medium-sized, black and white woodpecker.
It is distinguished from a downy woodpecker by its slightly larger size
and the lack of black bars on the white outer tail feathers.</p>
<p><span class="small">DOWNY WOODPECKER</span>&mdash;a smaller edition of the hairy woodpecker;
the white outer tail feathers are barred with black.</p>
<p><span class="small">SWAINSON&rsquo;S THRUSH</span>&mdash;distinguished by its russet back and brown-spotted,
buff breast; it is smaller than a robin but larger than a sparrow.
It sings in the late afternoon and evening; prefers a moist,
shady streamside habitat.</p>
<p><span class="small">RUFOUS HUMMINGBIRD</span>&mdash;described in <i>Birds of the Mountain Meadows and
Timberline</i>; it is abundant in the spruce forests along the coast during
nesting time.</p>
<h4><i>Birds Along the Streams</i></h4>
<p><span class="small">DIPPER</span>&mdash;a chunky, dark slate-colored bird, with a short, wren-like
tail, seen among boulders along swift-running streams. It bobs up
and down as it stands near the water and then plunges into the streams
to feed on the bottom.</p>
<p><span class="small">BELTED KINGFISHER</span>&mdash;a grayish-blue bird with white underparts and
a blue band across the breast; the female has a reddish sash. This
bird is distinguished by its large head, stout bill, and loud rattling
call. It dives from a tree into the water for fish.</p>
<p><span class="small">HARLEQUIN DUCK</span>&mdash;a rather small, dark-colored duck seen on the
rivers in spring and summer. The male is bluish above, has reddish-brown
flanks, a crescent of white in front of the eye, and various other
striking spots and streaks on head and neck&mdash;hence its name. The
female, though duller, also has white spots on the head.</p>
<p><span class="small">GREAT BLUE HERON</span>&mdash;a tall, lanky, slate-blue bird usually seen walking
knee deep in water. In flight, the neck is drawn back in an
S-shape.</p>
<p><span class="small">BALD EAGLE</span>&mdash;a large, powerful hawk with slow wing beats. Mature
birds, but not the younger ones, have white head and tail. Seen
along streams when fish are spawning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h4><i>Birds of the Ocean Shore</i></h4>
<p><span class="small">GLAUCOUS-WINGED GULL</span>&mdash;common along the shores even in summer.</p>
<p><span class="small">GREAT BLUE HERON</span>&mdash;described in <i>Birds Along the Streams</i>.</p>
<p><span class="small">BALD EAGLE</span>&mdash;described in <i>Birds Along the Streams</i>; it is common along
roadless stretches of the Pacific Coast area, where it nests in trees near
the shore.</p>
<p><span class="small">BLACK OYSTERCATCHER</span>&mdash;a large, black, sandpiperlike bird with a long
red bill and pink legs and feet, about the size of a half-grown chicken.</p>
<p><span class="small">DOUBLE-CRESTED CORMORANT</span>&mdash;a large, slender, black bird with a
slender, hooked bill; it is often seen with body nearly erect on a rock
in the water.</p>
<p><span class="small">COMMON CROW</span>&mdash;occurs in flocks; it caws, while ravens croak.</p>
<p><span class="small">COMMON RAVEN</span>&mdash;described in <i>Birds of the Mountain Meadows and Timberline</i>;
it is much larger than a crow and occurs chiefly in pairs, singly,
or in small groups; not in flocks.</p>

<h3 id="c17">FISH</h3>
<p>The Olympic Peninsula is noted for its many miles of beautiful
streams. This water provides an abundant world for fishes and gives
joy to the fisherman. In these coastal streams the fisherman&rsquo;s fishes
are trout and their relatives, the salmon.</p>
<p>Trout found in the streams include cutthroat, rainbow, brook,
Dolly Varden, and steelhead. The steelhead spends the greater part
of its life in the ocean, but enters fresh-water streams to reproduce.
After spawning, it returns to salt water. During its life span it may
make several winter spawning trips up the fresh-water streams. The
lives of sea-run cutthroat follow the same pattern, except they spawn
in autumn.</p>
<p>In autumn or spring, salmon of several species swim up-stream,
driving hard to reach the tributaries where they were hatched. Their
mission is to spawn. This is their grand and final act, for unlike the
steelhead, they do not return to the sea after spawning, but die. Sport
fishing for salmon is done chiefly in salt water, and the waters around
the Olympic Peninsula have become famous for the excellent salmon
sport fishing they afford.</p>
<p>Some mountain lakes contain rainbow and brook trout. Lake Mills,
which is impounded water, contains rainbow, brook, and Dolly Varden
trout.</p>

<p class="pcap">A COHO SALMON JUMPING THE RAPIDS OF THE SOLEDUCK RIVER.</p>
</div>
<p>The largest lake in the park, Lake Crescent, formerly contained two
varieties of trout that have not been found to be native anywhere
else. These were the Beardslee and the Crescenti, varieties of the
rainbow and cutthroat, respectively, which frequently reached a weight
of between 10 and 15 pounds. These varieties of trout probably no
longer exist in the pure state. Recent studies indicate that present
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
trout stocks, contaminated by plantings of hatchery fish that were
made before the park was established, are now hybridized from crossbreeding.
This is the usual story that follows upon man&rsquo;s interference
with natural waters&mdash;a story which has been repeated over and over
again in the United States.</p>
<p>A license is not required for fishing in the park. There are regulations,
however, pertaining to the season, open water, catch limit,
and method of fishing. A copy of these regulations may be obtained
at the superintendent&rsquo;s office or at a park ranger station.</p>
<h3 id="c18">OTHER ANIMAL LIFE</h3>
<p>In addition to mammals and birds there are other animals which,
though smaller and with less apparent personality, may be equally
interesting. They are part of the native wild fauna of the park and
are accorded the same protection as the larger forms. The few listed
below are frequently seen along trails.</p>
<p><span class="small">NORTHWESTERN TOAD.</span> This warty animal can be distinguished by the
light-colored line that runs down its back. It is common on forest
trails, but blends so well with the ground that it may not easily be
seen.</p>
<p><span class="small">PACIFIC TREEFROG.</span> This delicate, moist animal can be identified by
the adhesive pads on its toes with which it can cling to smooth surfaces.
It has a black line on each cheek, running through the eye.
The eyes have a bronze iridescence.</p>
<p><span class="small">PACIFIC COAST NEWT.</span> This attractive species of salamander can be
identified easily by its color&mdash;brown on top and orange underneath.
They are commonly seen in the spring when they congregate in ponds
and small lakes to spawn.</p>
<p>There are several other species of salamanders in the park that live
among the rotting logs in the damp woods.</p>
<p><span class="small">GARTER SNAKE.</span> This is probably the only snake you will see. <i>There
are no poisonous snakes on the Olympic Peninsula.</i></p>
<p><span class="small">COMMON SNAIL.</span> If not disturbed, this shelled creature of the woods
can be seen moving about carrying its &ldquo;house&rdquo; on its back. The shell is
about an inch across. The eyes are on the ends of two long stalks,
enabling the snail to see over obstructions.</p>
<p><span class="small">COMMON SLUG.</span> The grayish-green slug with its shiny mucous track is
abundant on many forest trails. Some of these slugs are blotched
with black.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">Pacific Coast Area</span></h2>
<p>There is a detached section of the park known as the Pacific Coast
Area. It is a narrow strip of land that borders the ocean for 50
miles&mdash;a scenic coastline of unusual interest. The Olympic Highway
(US. 101 and Wash. 9) runs through the southern 12 miles of it, but
the rest is roadless except for the road to the village of La Push.</p>
<p>The shore is broken by many rocky points separating sandy beaches.
Numerous needle rocks and small islands, having survived the abrasion
of the encroaching sea, rise offshore.</p>
<p>In places where ocean waves have worn back the land there are
rocky platforms that are under shallow water when the tide is in and
uncovered when the tide is out. Myriads of animals may be seen
among slippery sea plants, under rocks, and in pools left behind when
the water recedes. This is a between-the-tides museum, with mussels
and barnacles in dense communities holding to rocks near shore,
purple shore crabs scurrying for shelter under rocks, ochre and purple
starfish (blondes and brunettes of the same species), and numerous
limpets clinging tightly to rocks farther from shore. Colorful hydroids,
brilliant nudibranchs, chitons, sea urchins, and anemones in pools
also thrive where the shore is rocky and protected from strong waves.</p>
<p>Other creatures prefer the sandy beaches. On a weekend in clam
season, when the tide is low, the miles-long Kalaloch Beach becomes
pock-marked with holes and bumpy with piles from clam diggers&rsquo;
&ldquo;guns.&rdquo; A clam &ldquo;gun&rdquo; is a spade with a long, narrow blade set
nearly at right angle with the handle. Each year, seasons and limits
for razor clams are prescribed by the Washington State Department
of Fisheries. The season, which runs from spring to autumn, generally
coincides with the most favorable tides and surf for clam digging.</p>
<p>Quileute and Quinault Indians dip silver smelt out of the surf with
nets. These small fish ride in on the surf to spawn in the sand,
especially during the highest spring tides. Anyone may engage in
this fishing sport, with a hand dip net, under certain restrictions.
Current regulations pertaining to razor clam digging and smelt dipping
can usually be obtained in the immediate area.</p>
<p>Three Indian reservations lie within the ocean strip and a fourth
adjoins it on the south. One of these, the Ozette at the northern
end, is no longer inhabited, but there are still signs of the village site.
An unimposing bit of rock juts into the water here. This is Cape
Alava, which is distinguished by being the western extremity of our
country, exclusive of Alaska and Hawaii.</p>
<p>Numerous birds nest on the offshore islands. Many others make
rest stops during migration, as the strip lies within a major migration
flyway. Birds, including gulls, crows, oystercatchers, and cormorants,
are always present along the shore. Usually several bald eagles may
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
be seen during a hike along the beach. They build their nests mostly
in the tops of tall snags.</p>
<p>Mammals, too, appear on the beach. Raccoons and skunks take
advantage of low tides to feed on the various and abundant life available
then. Deer frequently come to the beaches, perhaps to escape
a cougar, to sun themselves, or to obtain salt or certain beach plants.
Not infrequently a black bear is seen, and, occasionally, an elk.</p>
<p>Camping on the beach is pleasant during dry weather. There is
ample firewood everywhere and small streams flow out of the forest,
providing fresh water. Some of the streams may be contaminated,
however, and the water should be either boiled or treated chemically
if its purity is doubtful.</p>
<p>There are several trails leading to the beach. Starting at the north,
the most important of these are the following:</p>
<p><span class="small">INDIAN VILLAGE TRAIL</span>, starting at Lake Ozette and extending 3 miles
to the Ozette village site at the beach, leads through delightful forest
and prairie. Much of the trail is a boardwalk made of split cedar
puncheon.</p>
<p><span class="small">SAND POINT TRAIL</span> also starts at Lake Ozette and is 3 miles long. The
distance between the Indian Village Trail and this trail is also 3 miles
along the beach. Thus, a triangular 9-mile round trip is possible.</p>
<p><span class="small">SECOND BEACH TRAIL</span> is about one-half of a mile long.</p>
<p><span class="small">THIRD BEACH TRAIL</span> is about three-quarters of a mile long. These two
latter trails start from the road near the village of La Push and lead
to attractive, clean, sandy beaches.</p>

<h3 id="c21">INDIANS OF THE OLYMPIC PENINSULA</h3>
<p>In aboriginal times, the Olympic Peninsula was a part of the
Northwest Coast cultural area, which stretched along the Pacific
shoreline from northern California to Alaska. The inhabitants of this
extensive region shared many cultural traits, perhaps the most distinctive
of which were a keen sense of personal property and a veneration
of wealth. These people did little to change their natural environment,
but they showed great skill in utilizing what resources their
primitive technology made available. Their dug-out canoes, for
instance, fashioned from tree trunks, were probably the finest which
have ever been made by any aboriginal people.</p>
<p>This remarkable culture was possible largely because the environment
provided an abundance of the necessities of life. Food was
easily obtained, and 3 or 4 months of gathering provided enough for
the balance of the year. Fish were the staple food. Salmon swarmed
up the streams of the Olympic Peninsula each summer and were
trapped or speared in great quantity. Smelt were dipped from the
surf, and clams and other shelled creatures were taken from the seashore.
The diet was augmented by berries and roots from the woodlands.
Elk, deer, and birds provided meat. Some of the Olympic
Indians hunted seals, porpoises, and whales. The capture of the
whales required daring journeys on the open sea in dug-out canoes 30
to 40 feet long and accommodating 6 to 8 men.</p>
<p>The great forests of the Peninsula were vitally important to the
Indian economy. Cedars provided hulls for canoes or were split into
planks for houses. From cedar bark were made baskets, mats, sails,
cordage, clothing, and other household necessities.</p>
<p>Most of the year these Indians lived in villages located above the
beaches along the ocean or arms of the sea, generally at the mouths
of rivers. Their permanent houses were stoutly built of planks. Some
of these rectangular structures, designed to accommodate several
families, were more than 60 feet long and 30 to 40 feet wide. Many
of them were beautifully decorated with painted designs. During
summer it was a common practice of these people to migrate, either
inland to gather berries and hunt, or along the watercourses to fish.</p>
<p>By primitive standards, the Indians of the Northwest Coast were
wealthy; that is, they had plenty of things to eat, wear, and use for
shelter. They also had much winter leisure. This combination of
wealth and leisure gave rise to a remarkable political and social
system in which power and prestige generally belonged to the richest
individuals.</p>
<p>An important feature of the social structure was the giving away of
possessions during a feast, called a potlatch. Years, even a lifetime,
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
of saving and privation were frequently endured in order to accumulate
sufficient wealth for this purpose. Guests were invited from many
tribes. The host gave such valuable gifts as canoes, slaves, food, fishing
equipment, and, in more recent years, commercial blankets. As a
rule, gifts were given only to guests who could afford to give a return
potlatch. Gift-giving was a good investment for the host because the
recipient was obligated to give a larger gift in return. This act of
giving away one&rsquo;s possessions elevated the giver and his family in the
social scale. Wealth was measured not so much in terms of what
was owned as by what was given away.</p>
<p>In recent years the Bureau of Indian Affairs has exerted pressure
to discourage the potlatch system, and it has declined greatly; but
potlatches are still held in modified form.</p>
<p>Today, the scene at Indian villages along the Olympic Peninsula is
quite unlike that of a century ago. The cedarplank communal houses
are no longer built; and, as the climate is not conducive to preservation,
the old ones have disappeared. White man&rsquo;s clothes have
replaced garments of skin and shredded bark. Customs, too, have
been modified under the impact of modern civilization. Still, much
of the old Indian tradition survives, though it may not be discernible
on the surface.</p>
<p>The main source of livelihood still is fishing. The Indians prefer to
use dug-out canoes, but now these are usually propelled by outboard
motors. Nearly every family owns a canoe, although only a few
expert canoe makers build them. They are similar to the oldtime
canoes in design, but the tools used to carve them are steel rather
than the stone, shell, or bone used for blades in primitive tools.</p>
<p>Thrilling dug-out canoe trips on the Quinault River are available
in summer for a moderate fee. The Quinault Indians at Amanda
Park, where the river flows out of Lake Quinault, offer such trips over
the entire distance of 35 miles to the ocean.</p>
<h3 id="c22">EXPLORATION BY SEA</h3>
<p>The first white men to explore the Olympic Peninsula came by sea.
Spanish navigators venturing northward from Mexico may have
coasted the shoreline as early as the 16th century. Juan de Fuca,
said to have been a Greek pilot in the service of Spain, claimed to
have entered the strait, which bears his name, in 1592, but satisfactory
proof of this discovery is lacking.</p>
<p>Extensive exploration of the Northwest Coast did not begin, however,
until the latter part of the 18th century, when rumors that the
Russians were venturing southward from Alaska stirred the Spaniards
to fresh efforts. In 1774, during the first of these renewed voyages,
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
Juan Perez saw the present Mount Olympus and named it &ldquo;Santa
Rosalia.&rdquo; He was the first European to name a geographic feature
in what is now the State of Washington.</p>
<p>During the next 25 years the Northwest Coast, including that of
the Olympic Peninsula, was widely explored and mapped by Spaniards,
Englishmen, and Americans. The Spaniards were the first actually to
set foot on the Peninsula. During a voyage made by Bruno Heceta
and Juan de la Bodega y Quadra in 1775, Heceta landed at Point
Grenville, near the mouth of the Quinault River.</p>
<p>Capt. James Cook was the first of several English navigators to
explore the Northwest Coast. In 1778, during his search for the
Northwest Passage, he named Cape Flattery, in the northwest corner
of the Olympic Peninsula. While on the coast, some of Cook&rsquo;s crewmen
obtained furs from the natives and later sold them in China for
high prices. This event turned the eyes of English and American
businessmen toward the Pacific Northwest, and thereafter exploration
of this region was stimulated by the fur trade.</p>
<p>In 1788, Capt. John Meares, an English trader, saw the mountain
which Perez had named 14 years earlier. Not knowing of the earlier
discovery, he christened the peak &ldquo;Mount Olympus.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Juan Francisco de Eliza, a Spanish captain, entered Juan de Fuca
Strait in 1791 and named the harbor, where present Port Angeles is
situated, &ldquo;Puerto de Nuestra Senora de Los Angeles,&rdquo; which means
&ldquo;Port of Our Lady of the Angels.&rdquo; In the following year the
Spaniards established a fort and settlement at Neah Bay. The members
of this colony, which existed for only 5 months, were the first
white settlers to touch the soil of the Olympic Peninsula and, indeed,
of the State of Washington.</p>
<p>In 1792, Capt. Robert Grey, an American trader, discovered the
harbor at the southern margin of the Olympic Peninsula which was
later named in his honor. Of all the explorers who came by sea,
George Vancouver, the English navigator, left the greatest mark in
northwest Washington. He explored Puget Sound waters in 1792 and
named numerous geographic features, including Port Townsend and
Discovery Bay, on the Olympic Peninsula.</p>
<h3 id="c23">EXPLORATION BY LAND</h3>
<p>At the same time that maritime traders and explorers were making
known the features of the coast, other adventuresome men were
opening overland trails into the Northwest. By 1810, fur traders
following in the wake of Alexander Mackenzie, David Thompson, and
Lewis and Clark were well established in the present British Columbia
and in the Columbia River drainage basin. After 1821, the British-controlled
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company dominated the fur trade of the
Pacific Northwest and for a number of years virtually excluded rivals
from the area.</p>
<p>During the 1830&rsquo;s and 1840&rsquo;s, however, American traders, missionaries,
and settlers in ever-increasing numbers pushed into the Northwest.
British influence declined as the American population grew,
until, in 1846, Great Britain bowed to the inevitable and gave up her
hopes of owning the region as far south as the Columbia River. In
that year the 49th parallel was established as the boundary between
American and British territory west of the Rockies.</p>
<p>Up to this time few American settlers had established homes on
the north side of the Columbia River. Following the adjustment of
the boundary dispute, pioneers rapidly pushed into the Puget Sound
basin. A few of these newcomers established themselves at Port
Townsend in 1851.</p>
<p>Although Port Townsend was the first permanent settlement on the
Peninsula, two trappers named John Sutherland and John Everett had
crossed the strait from Victoria in 1849 and had operated traplines
on the two large lakes west of Port Angeles. One lake still bears the
name of Sutherland. The other, first named Lake Everett, is now
known as Lake Crescent. The first permanent settlers in the Port
Angeles area did not take up claims until 1857.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Settlement of the Olympic Peninsula proceeded slowly, and the
mountains remained virtually unknown for several decades despite the
fact that the first ascent of Mount Olympus reportedly was made as
early as 1854. The first real attempt to explore the Olympic Mountains
was made in 1885 by an expedition under the leadership of
Lt. Joseph P. O&rsquo;Neil of the 14th Infantry. Starting at Port Angeles,
the explorers cut a trail past Mount Angeles to Hurricane Ridge.
They returned by the same route after investigating the country to
the southeast, perhaps as far as the head of the Lillian River.</p>
<p>The next major expedition into the Olympic Mountains was promoted
by Edmond Meany, the 27-year-old city editor of the Seattle
<i>Press</i>. At his instigation, the paper, on October 23, 1889, carried an
article calling attention to this unknown land and the need for
exploration. &ldquo;There is a fine opportunity,&rdquo; said the article, &ldquo;to acquire
fame by unveiling the mystery which wraps the land encircled by the
snow-capped Olympic range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meany persuaded the <i>Press</i> to finance an expedition, and a party
was organized, with James H. Christie, former hunter, Indian fighter,
and arctic explorer, as its leader. The company started up the Elwha
River in December 1889. It was believed that the mountains visible
from the coast were but an outer rim within which there was a central
valley, and by making a winter start the expedition hoped to be
over the first range and ready for work in the valley when spring
should come. This ignorance concerning the true character of the
mountains might have brought a tragic ending to the expedition had
the explorers not been experienced and resourceful in wilderness travel.</p>
<p>Six months later the party emerged from the mountains at Lake
Quinault, having endured severe hardships and privations without any
serious mishap. They had blazed a crude trail across the heart of
the unknown Olympics. They brought back photographs and a rough
topographic map of the country. They reported on its plants, animals,
and minerals, and they named 50 peaks, rivers, lakes, and other landmarks.
Many of these names remain today. Press Valley, on the
Elwha, was named for the newspaper which financed the expedition,
and the Bailey Range was named for William H. Bailey, the paper&rsquo;s
proprietor. Mount Meany perpetuates the name of the young city
editor, and Mounts Christie and Barnes honor, respectively, the leader
and narrator of the expedition.</p>
<p>The <i>Press</i> explorers had been out of the wilderness but a few weeks
when another expedition was organized. The Oregon Alpine Club
furnished a scientific staff and much of the money; the Army supplied
Lieutenant O&rsquo;Neil to lead the party and soldiers to assist. During
the summer of 1890 this expedition crossed the Olympic Mountains
from Hood Canal to Lake Quinault by way of the Skokomish and
Quinault Rivers. They, too, left names on many geographic features.
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
O&rsquo;Neil Pass and O&rsquo;Neil Creek were named for the leader, Mount
Henderson for the botanist of the party, and Mount Bretherton for
the naturalist-cartographer. In his report O&rsquo;Neil stated, &ldquo;while the
country on the outer slope of these mountains is valuable, the interior
is useless for all practicable purposes. It would, however, serve
admirably for a national park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These expeditions stimulated settlement on the fringes of the Olympic
Peninsula and in the river valleys. They also led to further exploration
of the interior and to a realization of the vast recreational
resources of this mountain fastness.</p>
<h3 id="c24">ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PARK</h3>
<p>Olympic Forest Reserve was established in 1897 by Executive order,
and was surveyed during the next 3 years, by Messrs. Arthur Dodwell
and Theodore Rixon. They produced the first accurate map and
gave a detailed account of the forests.</p>
<p>Efforts to preserve the Olympic wilderness started in 1904 when
Representative Francis W. Cushman introduced a bill for the establishment
of Elk National Park. The bill did not pass. In 1906 and
1908, Representative William E. Humphrey introduced bills to create
a game refuge on the Olympic Peninsula. These bills also failed.
Two days before the end of the Theodore Roosevelt administration he
asked the President to set aside a National Monument in the Olympic
Mountains under authority of the Antiquities Act of 1906. By Presidential
proclamation, Mount Olympus National Monument was
established in 1909.</p>
<p>The monument was within the boundaries of Olympic National
Forest. From 1909 to 1933, it was administered by the Forest Service,
U.S. Department of Agriculture. By Executive order, the monument
was transferred to the National Park Service, U.S. Department of the
Interior, on June 10, 1933.</p>
<p>Efforts to establish a national park in the Olympics were renewed
in 1935. Representative Monrad C. Wallgren repeatedly introduced
bills to have this done, but without success at first. President
Roosevelt visited the Olympic Peninsula in 1937 and expressed approval
of a large Olympic National Park. The act of June 29, 1938,
established Olympic National Park and abolished Mount Olympus
National Monument. The park now has an area of 1,400 square miles.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
